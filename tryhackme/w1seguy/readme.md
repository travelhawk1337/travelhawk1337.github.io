### Tasks

1. Source Code 

    Download the source code. Start the machine.

2. Get those flags!

    - What is the first flag?
        Reading the python script reveals that the flag is xorred with key of length 5 and then it is converted to hex. The character set used for the key is all the ascii_letters alongwith digits. It can be bruteforced easily, we can check whether the plaintext startswith "THM{" and ends with "}" or not. But that's not an elegant way to do that. Let's analyse it further.

        We know that the flag starts with "THM{" and ends with "}". The key is of length 5. On checking the length of unhexed flag we find it to be of length 40. The key can be easily generated again using the properties of xor:

        ```
        plaintext ^ key = ciphertext
        ciphertext ^ key = plaintext
        ciphertext ^ plaintext = key
        ```

        The first 4 letters of the key can be generated by xorring the encrypted_flag using "THM{". For the final letter we can take the xor of the last element of flag and "}". Here is a simple python script to achieve this:-

        ```python
	    def xor_break(encoded) :
	        u = bytes.fromhex(encoded) # Converting hex to bytes
	        key = "".join(chr(ord(x) ^ y) for x,y in zip("THM{", u[0:4])) # First 4 chars of the key
	        key += chr(ord("}")^u[-1]) # Final char of the key
	        print("key is: ", key)
	        flag = "".join(chr(u[i] ^ ord(key[i%5])) for i in range(0, len(u))) # Generating the flag
	        print(flag)
	    
	    xor_break("3f1d3b43475a341a56432e2d0279431f611553542a3b040b5607190f506219210f0842192d394a4a");
	    ```
        Answer:- `THM{p1alntExtAtt4ckcAnr3alLyhUrty0urxOr}`

    - What is the second and final flag?

        Answer:- `THM{THM{BrUt3_ForC1nG_XOR_cAn_B3_FuN_nO?}`
